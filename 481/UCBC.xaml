This club started because two guys, who otherwise would never have met, bouldered together a few times at the bouldering wall here at the U of C and became great friends, and we want to extend that friendliness and community to everyone we can. Of course, practically speaking, we're also dedicated to getting the best deals for excursions to climbing gyms all around Calgary, and hopefully planning a few outdoor trips of our own, so there is a lot to look forward to!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Tags:&#xD;&#xA;Sport, Interest/Hobby" VerticalAlignment="Top" Width="650"/>
